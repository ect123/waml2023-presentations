            I'm going to do my main acknowledgemnts first, because I don't want
            to make it sound as though I'm the only one at UBC library creating
            reuable workshops with graudate students. I'm lucky to have some
            amazing colleagues at UBC library who've made huge contributions in
            leveraging the talent, enthusiasm, and skills of our student
            employees. Out unit is relatively new, and we sort of learned all of
            this together. Allan Cho, Jeremy Buhler, and Eka Grguric were all
            equal partners in getting our reusable workflows started and all
            contributed to our grant from UBC's Teaching and Learning
            Enhancement Fund which provided the original funding for this
            project. I'm also using some slides that we made colalboratively for
            a previous presentation we did at the ACCESS 2020 conference. When I
            mention the Library Team in this presentation, these are the folks
            I'm referring to.

          <h2>In the Olden Days</h2>
          <p>Pre 2019, teaching material</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Many internal shared folders</li>
            <li>Non-portable and non-reproducible</li>
            <li>Uncoordinated approaches</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            In the olden days, long ago in the year 2019 and before, we didn't
            really have a solid method for creating, storing, and sharing our
            learning material. Things tended to be shared on network drives in
            folders, and often hard to find. They tended to be things like Word
            docs or PPT presentation that may not have had any version control
            or file histories attached, so in ways they were non-portable and
            non-reproducible. And our team approaches to creating and storing
            them were not well coordinated, leaving room for duplication of work
            and lessening the possibility for collaboration.

          <h2>Other challenges</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Info literacy + GIS teaching</li>
            <li>Keeping up with current trends in research and practice</li>
            <li>Accommodating teaching in busy calendars</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            And mixed in with inefficient workflows for creating and storing our
            Learning material, there were other challenges we were facing as
            well. Any of you who have responsibilities around teaching GIS, other areas of
            digital scholarship, you know that it can
            be very difficult to be a data management and informaiton literacy
            expert as well as a GIS instructor. These are oftten additional
            responsibilities that fall on our shoulders. We're expected to be
            the technical experts, to know the current trends, the have time to
            update and adapt teaching content in response to new software
            versions, and fit scheduling workshop events into our already busy
            calendars.

          <h2>Original Goals</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide teaching opportunites</li>
            <li>Pedagogical upskilling</li>
            <li>Develop new approcahes to developing teaching material</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            We recognized we can't always provide a wide range of up-to-date and
            relavent technical workshops to our community. At the same time, we
            knew that there are graduate students who have advanced skillsets in
            these areas, many of whom are hoping to gain instructional
            experience as they prepare to enter their professions. So we wanted
            to be able to somehow provide oportunities to student exerts – who
            have very relavent skillsets and are often more knowledgeable on
            current trends in teaching these skills that we realistically have
            the capacity for. We wanted to be able to upskill ourselves and
            students and experiment with teaching workflows. And here were
            especially inspired by the Carpentries OER model. And of course we
            wanted to develop these workflows in a way that alleviated some of
            the issues we were experiencing with our previous ones, being more
            reproducebible and collaborative.

          <p>Developing Reusable Technology Workshops to Enhance Digital Literacy</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            So in November 2019 we ended up applying for a grant from UBC's
            Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund. Or TLEF. This fund is meant
            "to enrich student learning by supporting innovative and effective
            educational enhancements", The title of our project was Developing Reusable Technology Workshops to Enhance Digital Literacy. In early 2020 with TLEF funding we hired
            4 graduate teaching assistants (or GTA's) to develop and deliver a
            series of 6 modular workshops on GIS / GIScience.

          <p><b>March-April 2020:</b> Hired 4 Graduate Students</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maya Daurio, ArcGIS</li>
            <li>Arthur Marques, R & Python</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            In April and May we hired 4 graduate students who would be our
            learning content creators. Each one had some exposure to GIS or
            spatial information, and speicifc technical skillsets that set them
            apart from one another

          <h3>TLEF Timeline</h3>
          <p><b>May 2020:</b> Onboarding and Orientation</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Intro to the team</li>
            <li>Reviewed goals and objectives</li>
            <li>Instructional skills workshop (CTLT)</li>
            <li>Introduction to Git and GitHub</li>
            <li>Discussed creative approaches to delivering workshops</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            The next phase of the project was onboarding and orientation. The
            student content developers met with the Library Research Commons
            team, we discussed the goals and objectives, and creative approaches
            to delivering workshops. We had just entered into COVID lockdown, so
            these conversations were really valuable to everyone as we were
            getting used to virtual workshop delivery. The Library team also
            provided Git and GitHub support for students - which we decided was
            going to be the platform for development, storage, and delivery
            (more on that in a moment) And we also scheduld a really informative
            Instructional Skills workshop hosted byt UBC's Center for Teahcingg, Learning, and Technology. Through this process, the students had an opportunity
            to refine their final workshop topics.

          <ul>
            <li>Students developed content</li>
            <li>Scheduled practive run-throughs</li>
            <li>content refinement</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            Then from May to June we gave the students time to create their
            content, before offering workshops internally to the library and
            academic partners to provide feedback. Feedback was then used to
            make further content refinements and adjustments.

          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            Then in July and August we scheduled the full series of workshops to
            be delivered two times by the content developers. These workshops
            were advertised openly using the Library's existing promotional
            channels. And finally after delivery, we wrapped up the project and
            off-boarded the students.

          <h2>Current approaches</h2>
          <p>
            UBC Library GIS workshop development and delivery workflows
            originate from TLEF grant
          </p>

          <aside class="notes">
            That was 2020. We renewed the project with TLEF in 2021 for creating digital scholarship workshops - very similar process with a couple of refinements. Today, We still use a lot of the original workflows that came from the TLEF
            grant to develop and deliver GIS workshops, but I think we've
            adapted to change with other realities like, the number of weekly hours students have available and the upfront time it takes to create a new workshop from scratch.

        <section>
          <h2>Still using GitHub</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            We haven't found a better replacement for using GitHub to manage the
            development of workshop content. The tools built into GitHub offer
            so much for collaboration, monitoring work, assigning work, checking
            edits and updates, and having conversations about specific elements
            of the content that's being worked on.
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Our workflow for developing workshops</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Topic decided</li>
            <li>Website from template</li>
            <li>Iterative refinement</li>
            <li>Project archiving</li>
          </ol>

          <aside class="notes">
            Our general approach is to first decide on a topic for the workshop - in most cases these have been related to one of the existing workshops (either developed through the TLEF grant, or by me). Then a new workshop website is create on GitHub with a draft of the workshop content. the next part is iteratively improving the site over a period of time before delivery. Typically, students and I use GitHub Issues to dissect the workshop-in-progress into small to-dos. GitHub Issues make it really efficient to document progress and assign tasks. So when we meet (usually weekly or bi-weekly) we can review the workshop, create issues for work that still needs to be done, and close certain issues that have been completed. We also create issues live when delivering workshops as a way of making notes for things that come up live - like spelling errors or requests from attendees for clarification, etc.

            Finally – and this part is still new to us - is to archive the project in Github. We have a lot of content in GitHub that was created by students that have graduated, and maybe we no longer want to offer those workshops in their current form. In we do have processes to add a note to the public-facing site saying that a particular workshop is no longer being updated or maintained, and we can also make this apparent on the GitHub backend where we archive the repository and lock it from further development. That doesn't mean we can't dulicate it at a later time and resurrect the workshop.
          </aside>

        <section>
          <h2>Reusing</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Designed to be "modular"</li>
            <li>Open license</li>
            <li>Integrated with GitHub</li>
          </ol>

          <aside class="notes">
         And finally, we really value the fact that these are open and allowed to be reused or remixed. We've always tried to design workshops in a way that makes them "modular" so that someone can take a lot of the content and reuse it outside of a UBC Library-delivered workshop. We VERY often refer people to our workshops in consultations - if they have questions about Leaflet, or map projections, or Storymaps - we have some ready-made content for them to refer to. I also know that our map projections workshop is regualrly used as a module in an Intro to GIS course in Geography. We also apply an open license CC Attribution 4.0 International, and make that very apparent in our template. And finally, because we're tied into the GitHub ecosystem, there are lots of ways anyone from outside of our organization can find and copy the workshop content to use for their own purposes.

      Just a quick shout out to the students that have been involved in this learning material generation process – I've been so fortunatle to have such amazing student colleageus and they've been so valuable in making our workflows better through their new ideas and perspectives, and also through their willingness to try things, test them, and ask questions.
