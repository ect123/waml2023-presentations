            I'm going to do my main acknowledgemnts first, because I don't want
            to make it sounds at all as though this is just me working on this
            project. I'm lucky to have some amazing colleagues at UBC library
            who've made huge contributions in leveraging the talent, enthusiasm,
            and skills of our student employees. Allan Cho, Jeremy Buhler, and
            Eka Grguric were all equal partners in getting this started and all
            contributed to our original grant from UBC's Teaching and Learning
            Enhancement Fund.

          <h2>The challenges</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            Any of you who have responsibilities around teaching GIS, digital
            scholarship, or other technical skills, you know that it can be very
            challenging. As library and information professionals, we often
            assume the position of data management and informaiton literacy
            expert among our academic communities. And we often teach those
            topics in the classroom. With functional and technical roles, like
            GIS, many of us are additionally expected to be the technical
            experts, to know the current trends, the have time to update and
            adapt teaching content in response to new software versions, and fit
            scheduling into our already busy calendars. These are some of the
            challenges the UBC Library Research commons has attempted to
            alleviate through finding ways to work collaboratively with UBC's
            student experts.

          <h3>Original idea</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            Our original idea stemmed from recognizing we can't always provide a
            wide range of up-to-date and relavent technical workshops to our
            community. At the same time, we recgonize that there are graduate
            students who have advanced skillsets in these areas, many of whom
            are hoping to gain instructional experience as they prepare to enter
            an academic profession. So we wanted to be able to somehow provide
            oportunities to student exerts â€“ who have very relavent skillsets
            and are often more knowledgeable on current trends in teaching these
            skills that we realistically have the capacity for.

          <h3>UBC Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund (TLEF) Grant</h3>
          <q
            >to enrich student learning by supporting innovative and effective
            educational enhancements</q
          >
          <aside class="notes">
            Luckily, at UBC there is a funding source that's meant "to enrich
            student learning by supporting innovative and effective educational
            enhancements", and we decided to apply in November 2019. In 2020 and
            2021 we hired eight graduate teaching assistants to develop and
            deliver a series of 12 modular workshops on GIScience and Digital
            Scholarship topics. In year one we focused on GISci and in year two
            we focused in Digital scholarship. The project also established a
            workflow for publishing open, reusable instructional content using
            GitHub. One goal of this project was for us to figure out ways to
            better streamline the creation, development, delivery, and iterative
            improvemnets of our workshop offerings, and we felt that GitHub was
            a great solution. We were already using it for GIS workshops
            somewhat, so there was some precidence for using it. But mainly it
            offered us tools to collaborate, share, update, and manage our work
            all in one platform. It also gave us ways to easily reproduce
            workshops, publish them online, and apply open licenses. The
            workflows for creating workshops we developed as part of these
            grants is now standard for UBC Library Research Commons workshops.
