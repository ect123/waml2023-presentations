            This is a lightning talk about British Columbia's Dominion Land
            Surveys. I have a hunch that most of you are somewhat familair with
            the U.S. Public Land Survey System. In Canada, there was a similar
            system used starting in the 1840s called the dominion land survey
            (DLS), which covers most of Manitoba, Saskachewan, and Alberta, and
            also small portions of BC.

          <h2>The Dominion Land Survey System</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Modelled after US Public Lands Survey System</li>
            <li>Uses series of 7 meridians at regular intervals</li>
            <li>Surveyor's diaries</li>
            <li>
              Depict historical features, placenames, and places of importance
              to Indigenous histories
            </li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            As I've said, the DLS is not unlike the US Public Land Survey
            System, but tere are some differences, with the main one being that
            the Canadian system is divided up on one continuous grid which uses
            a series of 7 meridians at regular intervals of 4 degrees longitude,
            and only one baseline at the 49th parrelllel. The surveys, like in
            the US, also accompany surveyors diaries, which are very rich
            resources for descriptions of the historical flaura and fauna of the
            area, but also describe encounters with Indigenous peoples already
            living on the lands that were being surveyed. And, they depict
            historical geographic features, placenames, and places of importance
            to indigenous histories.

            As many of you are aware, British Columbia's natural landscape is
            more pointy than the other western canadian provinces, and you can
            see here in this figure. So BC's rugged and remore landscape got in
            the way of an early survey of the lands of BC. And as a result only
            a small fraction of the Privince was ever surveyed under this
            system.

            The surveyng of biritish columia under the rules and guidelines of
            the dominion land survey system stems from BC's negotioan to become
            part of the dominion of canada in the early 1870s. In May of 1871,
            the original terms of the union specified The Dominion of Canada
            would build a railroad within 2 years of the union between the
            colony and the Dominion, to better connect the Pacific with the rest
            of Canada. In return, the Dominion would be granted the a 20-mile
            buffer of land surrounding the railway referred to as the railway
            belt (and shown here on this map). The dominion could use this land
            as they wish to further the development of the railway, as long as
            it remained public and not claimed by land grants. The union between
            BC and Canada happened in July of 1871, and construction of the
            railway was supposed start within two years, but that didn't happen
            for a variety of reasons, mainly because the dominion couldn't get a
            good guarentee from any protential contrators to build the railway.
            And while construction was being delayed, people were moving into
            these areas anyway and expecting to recieve land grants. The CPR was
            formed on 1881 and given the land of the railway belt. But because a
            lot of the land had already been settled, the Province agreed to
            compensate the dominion by giving them control of a separate block
            of land in northeast BC referred to as the Peace River Block.
            Although it took some time to begin, Surveys of the Railway belt and
            the Peace River Block ended in the 1930s, with many sections
            unsurveyed or incomplete.

            Survey's use the same township and range grid layouts as the US's
            PLSS, each containing 36 sections. Printed surveys are most commonly
            full townships, 1/4 townships, and sections. This is an example of a
            1/4 township survey, held at Library and Archives Canada, and
            showing a grid section somewhere in BC.

            Canada. The mains one being Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa,
            which hold surveys for all of Canada. BC Archives in Victoria BC,
            which have the correspondance copies of the ones at LAC plus
            surveyors diaries.

            We've been doing a little work to try and understand who has what by
            creating some geograhic indexes. This wasn't very easy to do,
            because we couldn't find a dominion land survey grid in GIS Format
            that covered BC. And because the grid is defined by both geographic
            and linear units it wasn't easy to create the grid from scratch in
            GIS. I don't know if any of you have tried working with both
            lat/long coordinates (for meridians and baselines) and distances
            from them (in feet and miles) in GIS, but kind of scrambles it's
            brains. Lukcily someone really smart created a dataset for Alberta,
            so we just copied that one between the 4th and 6th meridian, moved
            it over to BC, and changed each grid's attributes to reflect the
            meridians.
